Are people from different parts speaking variations/dialectues related with eachother due geographical proximities(like dialectes spreading across borders)in case they live close together but belong distinct cultural groupings?(either yes for some cases & no others).     \n5. Can we find out which specific variety / formulation does local population use when referring specifically about their own regional variant - whether its Standard Mandarin Or another one?.      \n6. If Yes then what kinda influence did historical events have on shaping current situation regarding usage among locals.(for example colonization effects etc.)        .        7.

In this case we can narrow down our search further since there aren't many places outside North America speaking primarily American varieties except for some Caribbean nations including Trinidad & Tobago whose official tongue isn't Spanish despite being geographically close enough - so let us focus specifically within those regions first before considering others globally if necessary later based upon results obtained thus far.. So what specific region does one refer when asking about \"Jamaica\"? Is 'Carriacou', another island nation off West Africa known mostly among locals rather than tourists perhaps more familiarly called just Cayman Islands instead given how similar they sound compared having different names altogether though still sharing same culture etc., relevant here too possibly yes depending whether someone meant exactly these two islands together versus separately individually respectively without implying either way explicitly otherwise unless"
