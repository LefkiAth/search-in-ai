However, I cannot find any Tibetan-speaking country with a population below 993,885,000. Therefore, it seems there might be an error or misunderstanding regarding the question."

However, Standard English (British English) is also widely spoken, particularly in formal settings such as education, government, and business. The majority of the population speaks Jamaican Patois fluently, although many are bilingual and can switch between the two languages depending on the context. Therefore, while Jamaican English may be considered the de facto national language, both forms of English play significant roles in the country's linguistic landscape."
