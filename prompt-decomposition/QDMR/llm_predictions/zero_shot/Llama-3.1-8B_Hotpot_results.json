What is the definition of \"Tibetan-speaking\"?\n   - Is this referring to people who speak Tibetic languages (such as Standard Tibetan or Dzongkha)?\n   - Or does it include other ethnic groups with cultural ties to Tibet?\n\n2. Which countries have significant populations of Tibetan speakers?\n   - This could be based on official census data, linguistic research, or estimates.\n\n3. How do we define \"significant\"? Should we consider only countries where Tibetan speakers make up more than half the population, or any country with at least some number of native speakers?\n\n4. We need to determine what constitutes a \"population of less than 993,885,000\".\n   - Are you looking for individual countries below this threshold, or total combined populations in multiple countries?\n\n5. Lastly, let's verify if there even exist countries with such low populations.\n   - If not, then our search might focus on smaller regions within larger countries.\n\nPlease clarify these points so I can better assist you."

        "zero_shot_decomposition": "To find the answer to your question, I'll break it down into simpler sub-questions:\n\n1. What is the primary language spoken in Tibet?\n2. Which countries have regions where Tibetan is used as an official or widely-spoken language?\n3. Is there any connection between Anren Town and the use of Tibetan?\n\nNow let's address each sub-question:\n \n1. The primary language spoken in Tibet is indeed Tibetan.\n2. Countries with significant usage of Tibetan include China (specifically, the Tibet Autonomous Region), India (in Ladakh region), Nepal, Bhutan, and parts of Pakistan.\n\nConsidering these points, we can now proceed to our next step by asking another set of sub-questions related specifically to Anren Town and its geographical location within one of those countries mentioned above.\n\nLet's ask some more specific sub-questions about Anren Town:\n \n1. In which province does Anren Town lie?\n2. Does this town share cultural or linguistic ties with other areas known for using Tibetan?\n\nBased on available information, here are answers to these additional sub-questions:\n \n1. According to my knowledge base, Anren Town lies in Sichuan Province.\n2. Given that Sichuan shares borders with the Tibet Autonomous Region, it's possible that certain towns might be culturally influenced by Tibetan traditions.\n\nCombining all previous steps together leads us towards answering your original query. \n\nThe final answer would likely involve identifying whether Anren Town itself speaks Tibetan due to being geographically close to the Tibet Autonomous Region but still located within Sichuan Province."

In this country, what languages do people commonly speak or use?\n\nAnswering these sub-questions will help us determine which language is used by the majority.\n\nSub-question 1:\nJamaica is known for using Jamaican Patois (also called Patwa) and Jamaican English as their main forms of communication.\n \n Sub-question 2:\nIn Jamaica, while many residents also speak other languages like Spanish due to immigration from Latin America, along with some French Creole, the official language is English. \n\nTherefore, based on our analysis, we can conclude that the most common language in Jamaica, where Jamaican English is spoken, is indeed English."

In what official or widely-spoken languages do people communicate in Jamaica?\n2. Are there any other notable dialects or regional variations within those primary languages?\n\nFor Jamaica, based on available information:\n \nEnglish and Jamaican Patois (also known as Patwa) are both recognized national languages; however English serves primarily as the standard business and educational language while Jamaican Patois has significant cultural importance. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the main language(s) associated with the country using the Jamaican dollar would be English and/or Jamaican Patois."
