        "3_shot_decomposition": "I cannot directly answer your question as there are no countries with a Tibetan-speaking population under 993,885,000 where every citizen speaks Tibetan as their first language. However, Bhutan is a country where Tibetan (Dzongkha) is one of its national languages but has a much smaller population of around 740,000 people. Another example would be Nepal, which has a significant number of Tibetans living within its borders, but the total population is over 29 million. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria you provided."

In the case of Jamaica specifically, while Jamaican English has its unique characteristics, Standard English is also widely used in formal settings and education."

There is no evidence that any institution during his time had more postgraduate students than where he studied or worked."
