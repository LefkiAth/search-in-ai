The first part asks what kind or type ('common') we need - here referring specifically towards primary/officially recognized lingua franca i.e mainstream communication medium etc.. Second aspect involves identifying specific region(country) associated with mentioned dialect('Jamaica'). Last but important point would involve understanding political history & affiliations related parties like Prime Ministerial tenure alongwith party names such PML indicating Pakistani context rather than Caribbean one hence clarification needed there too! So breaking these points further yields :   \na.) Identify predominant official / dominant localized vernacular across nations globally; b.) Pinpoint exact nation linked wth given colloquy style expression c.). Determine historical leadership figures during specified timeline d)..
