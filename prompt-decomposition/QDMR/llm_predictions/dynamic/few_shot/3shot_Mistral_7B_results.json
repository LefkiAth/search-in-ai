He attended Simpson College for undergraduate studies and Iowa State Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) for graduate work. However, there isn't any definitive evidence suggesting that either institution had a larger number of postgraduates during Carver's time than other institutions he may have attended or been affiliated with. Therefore, it would be an incorrect assumption to answer this question definitively without further research."
