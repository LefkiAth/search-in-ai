      " To solve this complex query, we can divide it further by asking these subquestions which will help us in finding out if both directors share commonalities or differences regarding their origin/national identity (country): 1) Who was born first between them - This would give an idea about who might have been influenced more significantly during his formative years due possibly being from different countries at those times;  2) What country were they each originally associated with before moving on for filmmaking career – It's possible one moved abroad while starting off as director but still maintaining ties back home through family etc.;   3) Did either move permanently away after establishing themselves professionally– If so then what new place did he settle iin ? These steps should provide enough information needed not only answer whether 'Scott derickson & ed wood shared similar origins',but also shed light upon how much influence such factors had over shaping up individual styles respectively . The answers derived could be cross verified against known facts related moviemaking careers thus ensuring accuracy without any ambiguous interpretations arising later! Finally combining all findings together gives final verdict answering original posed inquiry effectively.. So let’s get started breakingdown mentioned above points accordingly… Let me know when you need assistance again ! Good luck :) Hopefully everything goes smoothly now...

      " To solve this complex query, we can divide it further by asking these subquestions which will help us find out if both landmarks belong together geographically or not within their respective cities (Istanbul): 1) What city do each of them reside - Islahiye Mahallesi/Laleli district for mosques & Istanbul's Beylerbeyi Palace area near Bosphorus Bridge / Eyüp Sokak street corner with Kızkule Caddesimi school building;2). Do they share any common boundaries – Checking maps would be required here as well.;3.) How close apart from one another on map– This could involve measuring distance between two points using mapping tools like Google Maps.,4.). Any historical records indicating proximity during certain periods—This might require research through local archives./historical documents..5).. Local residents’ perception about being part 'of neighbourhood'. Here you may need surveys conducted among locals who have lived there over generations...6 ). Cultural significance shared amongst neighbours--Understanding cultural events held at either location where people gather around those places…7 ) Tourist reviews mention similarities when visitng nearby attractions --Analyzed data collected via tourism websites etc....8 . Public transportation routes connecting locations —Check bus lines ,metro stations ..9)& Social media posts tagged along specific areas showing pictures taken simultaneously.-Lastly but important too! If possible try finding official guides talking specifically regarding such matters(like travel bloggers),they usually provide detailed insights based upon personal experiences while exploring different parts offourth most populous metropolis worldwide---Turkey!!

      "2. Break it down into smaller parts:\n",
      "   - \"Laleli Mosque\" (the name of the mosque) and \"Esma Sultan Mansion\" (the name of the mansion) are two separate entities, but they share some common features such as being located near each other on the same street or having similar architectural styles.\n",
      "3. Ask open-ended questions to gather more information:\n",
      "   - Can you provide me with any additional details about the location of these buildings? For example, do they have different addresses or are they part of the same complex?\n",
      "4. Use context clues from the given material to narrow down possible answers:\n",
      "   - If there's no mention of an address for either building, can you find out if they're both located within the same city limits or if one is closer than the other?\n",
      "5. Consider alternative explanations based on the given material:\n",
      "   - If neither building has an official address, could you try searching online for their current locations using maps or Google Street View?\n",

      "4. Ask clarifying questions: We now have two options left - either the director is working at a studio in New York City or they work as an independent contractor. To narrow this down further, we ask if the director has their own office space or if they rent from someone else.\n",
