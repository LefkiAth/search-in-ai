Or\n5b Did they share similar professions as filmmakers like their counterparts from question 6 below but were actually different individuals altogether due solely on confusion arising out of shared names between them all three people involved here - namely one being Scottish-born American filmmaker known for his horror films; two others sharing first-name similarities yet having distinct careers outside filmmaking such as music production & acting respectively.\n6 Are both these persons related somehow through blood ties despite differences existing among us regarding nationalities discussed earlier within context provided by preceding queries made thus far up until now including possible familial connections amongst aforementioned trio comprising firstly said director whose works include Saw franchise alongside fellow collaborators responsible behind scenes during pre/post-production phases while lastly remaining third party collaborator(s), potentially even credited uncreditedly depending upon circumstances surrounding release dates pertaining specifically towards latter half decade spanning late '90s till early/mid-'00's era wherein respective timelines overlap significantly enough warranting further investigation beyond mere surface-level comparisons drawn previously based exclusively"
