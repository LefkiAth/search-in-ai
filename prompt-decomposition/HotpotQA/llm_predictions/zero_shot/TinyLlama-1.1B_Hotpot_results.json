Break it down into smaller, more specific parts: \"Scott Derrickson was born in Illinois while Ed Wood was born in California.\"\n3. Ask open-ended questions to encourage further explanation: \"What made Scott Derrickson's birthplace different from Ed Wood's?\" \"How did their upbringings influence their filmmaking styles?\"\n4. Use examples or anecdotes to illustrate your points: For example, you could mention how Derrickson grew up watching horror movies with his father while Wood worked on Bela Lugosi films as a child.\n5. Provide evidence or supporting details to support your claims: For instance, if you believe that Derrickson's upbringing influenced his decision to make darker, grittier films like The Exorcist, you might cite one particular scene where he used shadows and darkness to create tension.\n6. Repeat key phrases or ideas to reinforce them: If you feel confident about your answer, repeat key words or phrases back to yourself several times to help solidify your understanding. This can also be done verbally during discussion or writing.\n7. Refine your response over time by revisiting previous steps and gathering additional information. Remember to remain objective and avoid personal opinions or emotions."

        "zero_shot_decomposition": "1. Identify the main idea or central theme of the question. In this case, it's \"What government position was held by the woman who portrayed Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell?\"\n2. Break down the question into its component parts. In this case, we have two subquestions:\n   - Who portrays Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell? (the answer is \"Wendy Hiller\")\n   - What government position did she hold at the time? (the answer is \"Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs\" )\n3. Ask each subquestion separately. For example, here's how you might ask the first subquestion:\n   - \"Who portrays Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell?\"\n4. Use your knowledge of the context to help guide your response. In this case, Wendy Hiller played the role of Corliss Archer in the film Kiss and Tell, which was released in 1960. The Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs was a high-ranking government position during the Cold War era, so answering this subquestion would provide some insight into the political climate of the time.\n5. Repeat the process with any other subquestions in the original question. By breaking down the question into smaller components, you can gain more specific information about the topic being discussed. This will make your responses more accurate and relevant."

Ask open-ended questions to gather more information:\n   - Can you provide me with any additional details about the location of these buildings? For example, do they have different addresses or are they part of the same complex?\n4. Use context clues from the given material to narrow down possible answers:\n   - If there's no mention of an address for either building, can you find out if they're both located within the same city limits or if one is closer than the other?\n5. Consider alternative explanations based on the given material:\n   - If neither building has an official address, could you try searching online for their current locations using maps or Google Street View?\n6. Repeat steps until a clear answer emerges:\n   - Keep asking open-ended questions and looking for evidence to support your initial hypothesis.\n7. Once you have a clear answer, summarize it concisely and communicate it clearly to others involved in the project."

Break down the question into its component parts: Based on where the director lives, it can be inferred that he/she works for a film production company located in New York City.\n\n3. Eliminate irrelevant information: Since we know that the director's location is important, we need to eliminate any other possible locations mentioned in the original question. This eliminates \"Los Angeles,\" which does not fit with the context and only adds confusion.\n\n4. Ask clarifying questions: We now have two options left - either the director is working at a studio in New York City or they work as an independent contractor. To narrow this down further, we ask if the director has their own office space or if they rent from someone else.\n\n5. Rephrase the question: By asking about whether the director has their own office space or rents from others, we have narrowed our focus even more. Now we only have one option remaining - the director is working out of their home.\n\n6. Use the answer provided by the original questioner: Finally, we confirm that the director is indeed living in New York City and working for a film production company there.\n\nOverall, breaking down the complex question step-by-step helped us identify the most relevant information and narrow down our search."
