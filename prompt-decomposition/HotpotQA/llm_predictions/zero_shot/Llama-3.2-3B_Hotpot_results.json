I don't want something like \"job-hopper\" because it implies they've tried several things without success.\n\nThe closest thing I can think of is \"jack-of-all-trades\", but there's no implication that they're any good at anything (and if you know what I mean by jack-of-all trades then you'll understand why I'd prefer not to use it).\n\nAny suggestions would be appreciated!\n\n-\nYou could say he/she is a generalist –  user16269 Jan 17 '12 at 16:05\n@Mehrdad - That sounds about right!
