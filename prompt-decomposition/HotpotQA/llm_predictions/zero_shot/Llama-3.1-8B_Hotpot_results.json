What is Scott Derrickson's nationality?\n2. What was Ed Wood's nationality?\n\nWe can then use these individual pieces of information to answer the original question:\n\nIf both individuals share the same nationality (as determined by their respective nationalities), then they would be considered as being from the \"same\" nationality.\nHowever, if one or both have different nationalities, it will indicate otherwise.\n\nLet me provide some general knowledge about them:\nScott Derrickson - Born in Denver Colorado USA \nEd Wood - Born in Poughkeepsie New York USA \n\nBased on this information, since both directors were born within the United States, we could conclude that they shared the same nationality which is American."

Identify the director of the movie 'Big Stone Gap'.\n2. Determine if there's any publicly available information about their location or base.\n3. If yes, identify whether they're specifically mentioned to be from one of the cities within New York state.\n\nLet me provide more details on these points:\n \n1. The film was directed by Adriana Trigiani and Thomas Schumacher (co-director) but primarily known for being written and adapted by Adriana Trigiani herself who also co-directed it with Tom Hanks not involved as much though he did produce it along side Gary Goetzman. \n\n2. There isn't enough public data readily available regarding her exact place of residence however she does have roots in Virginia where Big Stone Gap itself takes its name from so we can assume some connection here at least.\n\nHowever since you asked about New York State let us proceed further assuming our goal remains finding something related to NY even though no direct link has been established yet between Adriana Trigiani and NYC.\n\nSince my previous answer didn’t give clear results, I will rephrase your original query focusing only on possible connections to New York Cities. Here’s how I would approach breaking down the problem again:\n\n1. Is Adriana Trigiani associated with any projects set in New York?\n2. Does she reside near any major New York City locations?\n\nUnfortunately without concrete evidence linking Adriana directly to either of those two possibilities above, I am unable to conclude anything definitive about her current residency status in relation to New York State."
