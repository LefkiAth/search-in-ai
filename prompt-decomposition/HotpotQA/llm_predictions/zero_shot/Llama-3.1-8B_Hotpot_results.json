Here's how I can help by breaking it down into several smaller questions:\n\n1. **What was Scott Derrickson's birthplace?**\n   - This will give us an idea of his country of origin.\n\n2. **Is Scott Derrickson American-born or has he claimed another nationality in public statements/interviews?**\n   - If he claims another nationality, this could be our answer; otherwise, we'll proceed with further research.\n\n3. **Where did Ed Wood Jr., also known as Edward Davis Wood Jr., grow up/born?**\n   - Knowing where Ed Wood grew up or was born might indicate his nationality.\n\n4. **Was Ed Wood considered American throughout his life/career?**\n   - Researching whether Ed Wood identified himself as American during his lifetime would provide insight into his nationality.\n\n5. **Are there any credible sources confirming both Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood held the same nationality (e.g., U.S. citizenship)?**\n   - Verifying through multiple reliable sources will ensure accuracy regarding their shared nationality status.\n\n\n\nBy answering these individual questions, we should have enough evidence to conclude whether Scott Derrickson and Ed Wood share the same nationality."
