Clarify if we're looking at two different people altogether; one being American screenwriter/producer/special effects artist/scenographer/directing editor/editorial supervisor Stephen Daldry (\"Stephen\") best-known works include Billy Elliot Part II & 2010 A.D.; while other could possibly refer incorrectly due confusion between names – hence need more accurate identification on both persons involved originally queried:\n6.
