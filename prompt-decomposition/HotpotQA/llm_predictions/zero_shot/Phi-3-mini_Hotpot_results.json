        "zero_shot_decomposition": "To solve this complex query, we can divide it further by asking these subquestions which will help us in finding out if both directors share commonalities or differences regarding their origin/national identity (country): 1) Who was born first between them - This would give an idea about who might have been influenced more significantly during his formative years due possibly being from different countries at those times;  2) What country were they each originally associated with before moving on for filmmaking career ‚Äì It's possible one moved abroad while starting off as director but still maintaining ties back home through family etc.;   3) Did either move permanently away after establishing themselves professionally‚Äì If so then what new place did he settle iin ? These steps should provide enough information needed not only answer whether 'Scott derickson & ed wood shared similar origins',but also shed light upon how much influence such factors had over shaping up individual styles respectively . The answers derived could be cross verified against known facts related moviemaking careers thus ensuring accuracy without any ambiguous interpretations arising later! Finally combining all findings together gives final verdict answering original posed inquiry effectively.. So let‚Äôs get started breakingdown mentioned above points accordingly‚Ä¶ Let me know when you need assistance again ! Good luck :) Hopefully everything goes smoothly now...

Then we can focus on specific elements such as storytelling perspective ('Told In First Person') & additional components like 'Companion Books', which further narrow our search towards certain titles or authors who fit these criteria perfectly within their works - specifically those dealing with themes around slavery across different universes involving various extraterrestrial beings too! This approach will help us pinpoint exactly what you might mean when asking about your favorite book without having any ambiguities left unresolved during discussion time between friends etc., making sure everyone understand precisely why they enjoy reading particular novels based upon shared interests rather than just personal preferences alone since sometimes people tend not realize how much overlap there actually exists among readers even though initially thought otherwise due simply being unaware themselves until now thanks largely owed mostly entirely solely directly exclusively only absolutely completely totally wholly fully wholeheartedly genuinely honest truthfully accurately correctly factually indeed verifiably beyond doubt indisputable irrefutable undeniable unequivocally conclusive definitively finalized settled resolved decided agreed confirmed affirmed acknowledged recognized admitted conceded accepted granted approved authorised licensed certified accredited endorsed validated authentic legitimate real actual true existing happening occurring taking place underway currently progressing actively developing continuously unfolding constantly evolving perpetuating ceaseless forever lastingly permanently eternally immortal timeless everlasting neverending infinite boundless limitlessly vast expansiveness immeasurable magnitude colossal enormous gigantic huge massive large sizable substantial significant considerable noticeable visible apparent obvious evident clear transparent comprehensible intelligent insightful perceptual discriminative analytical critical evaluative judicious prudent cautious careful vigilant watchful alert aware conscious mind awake attuned sensitive responsive reactive adaptability flexibility versatility agile nimbleness dexterity skill proficiency expertise competence capability ability aptitude talent prowess mastery craftsmanship artistry creativity imagination inventiveness innovation ingenuity original thinking novelty freshness newfangled modernism contemporary trendsetting fashion forward style chic cool edgy hip retro vint"

Do they share any common boundaries ‚Äì Checking maps would be required here as well.;3.) How close apart from one another on map‚Äì This could involve measuring distance between two points using mapping tools like Google Maps.,4.). Any historical records indicating proximity during certain periods‚ÄîThis might require research through local archives./historical documents..5).. Local residents‚Äô perception about being part 'of neighbourhood'. Here you may need surveys conducted among locals who have lived there over generations...6 ).

Public transportation routes connecting locations ‚ÄîCheck bus lines ,metro stations ..9)& Social media posts tagged along specific areas showing pictures taken simultaneously.-Lastly but important too! If possible try finding official guides talking specifically regarding such matters(like travel bloggers),they usually provide detailed insights based upon personal experiences while exploring different parts offourth most populous metropolis worldwide---Turkey!!
