Can you find records confirming if \"USS Iwo Jima\" was used specifically as part of space mission recoveries like those involving astronauts such as Jim Lovell on Apollos 8 through 14 including incidentally involved crew members Fred Haise & Ken Mattingly who were aboard Skylab flights STS–91/92 respectively but never actually flew them due to illness.\n5. Does “Iwo” refer directly back historically linked namesake events related primarily within WW-II context rather than being associated more broadly across different eras’ naval operations globally by US Navy at large over time period spanning decades since its commissioning date May-June-August-November December1957 till decommissioning August1996 inclusive excluding interim periods when it served under various designations prior thereto e.g., CVL/CVS(LSM) LSM(R)-503 before becoming CVS(L)."

Or does 'win' also include playoff series such as Conference Finals/Stanley Final itself where multiple players contribute towards victory over time span rather than single game performance.\n5. In case it's related with individual player contribution - do we consider specific player's role crucially important during these stages while considering their overall impact on team's success throughout entire tournament duration till final match(s)? 6. If yes then which particular position/team roles would have most significant influence if removed from team composition entirely ?7. Considering all above factors , can one conclude whether absence/tampering/injury affecting key positions including Tibial ones could potentially hinder chances significantly enough so much they might lose out even before reaching finals stage .8. Would there exist exceptions based upon different scenarios e.g high level talent pool compensating loss etc.?9.Isn't every sport having its own unique set-up & rules making comparison across them difficult unless explicitly stated otherwise?.10.Are certain types of injuries more likely impacting critical aspects required at higher levels thus"
